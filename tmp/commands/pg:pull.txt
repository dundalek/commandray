Usage: heroku pg:pull SOURCE TARGET

pull Heroku database into local or remote database

 -a, --app APP       # app to run command against
 -r, --remote REMOTE # git remote of app to run command against

Pull from SOURCE into TARGET. TARGET must not already exist.

To delete a local database run `dropdb TARGET`

TARGET will be created locally if it's a database name or remotely if it's a fully qualified URL.

Examples:

  # pull Heroku DB named postgresql-swimmingly-100 into local DB mylocaldb
  $ heroku pg:push postgresql-swimmingly-100 mylocaldb

  # pull Heroku DB named postgresql-swimmingly-100 into remote DB at postgres://myhost/mydb
  $ heroku pg:push postgresql-swimmingly-100 postgres://myhost/mydb
