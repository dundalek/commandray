   --country COUNTRY         # country of owner, as a two-letter ISO country code
   --area AREA               # sub-country area (state, province, etc.) of owner
   --city CITY               # city of owner
   --subject SUBJECT         # specify entire certificate subject
   --now                     # do not prompt for any owner information
