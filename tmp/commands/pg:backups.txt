    --wait-interval SECONDS      # how frequently to poll (to avoid rate-limiting)
  restore [[BACKUP_ID] DATABASE] # restore a backup (default latest) to a database (default DATABASE_URL)
    --wait-interval SECONDS      # how frequently to poll (to avoid rate-limiting)
  public-url BACKUP_ID           # get secret but publicly accessible URL for BACKUP_ID to download it
    -q, --quiet                  #   Hide expiration message (for use in scripts)
  cancel [BACKUP_ID]             # cancel an in-progress backup or restore (default newest)
  delete BACKUP_ID               # delete an existing backup
  schedule DATABASE              # schedule nightly backups for given database
    --at '<hour>:00 <timezone>'  #   at a specific (24h clock) hour in the given timezone
